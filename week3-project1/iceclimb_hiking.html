    <p><em>Glacier</em> Experience is a small group experience that offers an easy glacier hike on Sólheimajökull glacier
      with an experienced glacier guide and is available all year around. The tour offers a pick-up from Reykjavik or a meet
      on location at Sólheimajökull glacier. Add even more adventure to your stay in Iceland and come explore this amazing
      crawling glacier with us. </p>
    <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand
      volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the
      location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land! </p>
