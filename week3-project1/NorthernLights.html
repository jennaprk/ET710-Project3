    <p><em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</em> or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere--at altitudes from 60 to more
      than 250 miles--when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing
      light show.</p>
    <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd
      like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above
      55Â° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>
    <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near
      equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora
      seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your
      location here, or by using a sky guide app. </p>
